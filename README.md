For this mini-project, I had to plan the design and development of a multi-page website for Iris Pharma, a naturist pharmacy owned by a person whom I reached out to. When it comes to my development, the purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development and to demonstrate my ability to undertake a complete development cycle. I selected this project having in mind that I want to practice more on the modern web development practices, including front-end design and back-end programming.
