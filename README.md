For this mini-project, I had to plan the design and development of a multi-page website for Iris Pharma, a naturist pharmacy owned by a person whom I reached out to. When it comes to my development, the purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development and to demonstrate my ability to undertake a complete development cycle. I selected this project having in mind that I want to practice more on the modern web development practices, including front-end design and back-end programming. 
To make this website function properly please make sure you have XAMPP installed with ADMIN and MYSql actions started
After that enusre that all the downloaded files are copied in a folder named iripharma, within your htdocs folder( found in the XAMPP original installed folder)
Also please note that all images must be in their own folder called images within the irispharma folder. They must be named accordingly otherwise the website will not work as it should, unless you change the code to match your naming situation :D. 
Once all of the steps have been completed as per the tutorial you can access this link : http://localhost/irispharma 

Thank you for your time!
